# ngram-keychords

Deciding appropriate letter-pairs we can use for keychording seems a daunting task, but by analyzing Google's N-Gram datasets, we can find the *least common* key-pairings in the English language, and avoid conflicts.

This isn't infallible; the pair "dk" seems to be infrequent enough to include in the list of preferable chord-pairs, but if you type "mkdir", "weekday" (!), or "bodkin" enough, your prose will eventually collide with a command.

I've included a list of keypairings I've bound to commands, along with some commentary about their utility, but if you want to do your own analysis, check out the datasets themselves:

My preferred Emacs chording package is keychord.el, as demonstrated in

Emacs Rocks! Episode 7

The way you bind the command to a keychord using this package is:

`(key-chord-define-global "fj" 'delete-local-region)`

Here is the list of keychords I currently use:
```
;; Home row to number row keybindings are too stretchy
;; Numrow to numrow conflicts with *actual* number entry.

;; ;; Left-hand numrow chords

;;Natural toprow and numrow
"e1"
"e2"

"r2"
"r3"

"t3"
"t4"

;; Inverted toprow and numrow (only q is acceptable, ime)
"q3"
"q4"

"w4"
"w5"

"e5"
"e6"

;; Slightly awkward close pairings
"q1"
"w2"
"e3"
"r4"
"t5"

;; ;; Right-hand numrow chords

;; Natural toprow and numrow
"u9"
"u0"

"y8"
"y9"

"i0"
"i-"

"o-"
"o="

;; Inverted toprow and numrow (only [ is acceptable, ime)
"[-"
"[0"
